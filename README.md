# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis  

##  Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone**.  
The main goal is to analyze behavioral differences between **casual riders** and **annual members** of Cyclistic, a bike-share company, and to provide recommendations for converting casual riders into long-term members.

## Key Findings  
- Casual riders tend to have **longer trips** than annual members.  
- Casual riders have **higher trip counts during weekends**, while annual members ride more in the middle of the week.  
- Both casual riders and annual members ride the most **around midday, before evening**.  
- Summer is the **peak season** for both casual riders and members in Chicago.  
- Casual riders use **electric bikes slightly more** than classic bikes, while members show nearly equal usage of both.  

## Recommendations  
- Introducing plans that may be interesting for **casual riders during the summer-time**. The marketing for these plans should be done in the winter.
- Introducing plans that cover **just the weekends** with lower prices than other plans. 
-Introducing plans that cover only **electric bikes** with lower prices  as it is more in-demand
